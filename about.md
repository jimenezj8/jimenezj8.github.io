# About me

I'm currently a senior studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. My major is in Nuclear Science and Engineering, and I am also completing a minor in Economics, a minor in Energy Studies, and a concentration in Philosophy!

So why did I create this site? Like every person, I've got hobbies too; it turns out that I really like programming, just not enough to get a rigorous education in Computer Science. The topics are far too broad, and the applications seemed uninteresting to me. So here I am, adding my beginner-level projects to a website generated for me by Github.

When I was a freshman, I realized that I was extremely tired of using Windows on my hardware - it was extremely unreliable at times, and didn't feel like I had a lot of room for customization. Eventually, I made the switch to Ubuntu and never looked back. Ok, that's not entirely true - I partitioned half of my hard drive for Windows because I wanted to make sure I would still be able to use all of the software I was used to if I needed it. 

Working on Ubuntu made me see how much I could learn just by reading through forums of people asking for help. I quickly fell in love with the ideology of the developer, and began reading pages and pages about the GNOME shell. Now, I'm working on creating my own extensions that could get published on the extensions site, but that will be determined in the future. I've also begun working on several projects on my own out of boredom and interest, including a virtual dominoes platform where you can team up with a custom-built AI against a friend!

Mostly, I wanted to document my work somewhere so I never have to worry about losing the information that I've learned throughout my work. I can't tell you how many bookmarks I've created for posts on AskUbuntu and the GNOME forums. By compiling it all here, I hope to someday help an aspiring developer learn the ropes without having to sift through all of the information that is probably not relevant to what they want to do.
