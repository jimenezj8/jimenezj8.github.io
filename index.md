# About
I'm using this website as a means to keep myself organized with personal projects and also show people what I get up to in my free time. I don't often finish the projects I've started, so don't be surprised to find things incompleted. On display currently, I have some software as well as articles on all sorts of topics. Additionally, while not accessible through this website, I have some science fiction writing samples that I can send on request, subject to my approval. I've made a few quick links to help you navigate around the site. Enjoy!
