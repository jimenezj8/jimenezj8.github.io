# Password Manager
This password manager is an application that I wrote because I was tired of having to use the same passwords over and over again simply because so many service require me to create them. I also don't really trust any other keyrings, besides the one that's built into my operating system and that I know doesn't communicate with any companies. 

My solution? I created a program of my own, a Python script that runs on startup every time I turn on my laptop. I don't need to worry about turning it on, and I can always access my account information by clicking on an icon in the top of my screen! Now, I don't need to worry about forgetting the account information to a service that wasn't running through a web browser - all I have to do is save it with this program.
